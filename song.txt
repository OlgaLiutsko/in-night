Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know
We never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all


To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?
